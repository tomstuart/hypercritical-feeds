# Hypercritical RSS feeds

Three useful feeds for the [Hypercritical](https://hypercritical.fireside.fm/) podcast:

* [All Hypercritical episodes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomstuart/hypercritical-feeds/main/hypercritical.rss) (a copy of the [official feed](https://feeds.fireside.fm/hypercritical/rss))
* [All “After Hypercritical” After Dark episodes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomstuart/hypercritical-feeds/main/afterdark.rss) (a copy of the [official feed](https://feeds.fireside.fm/afterdark/rss) with non-Hypercritical episodes removed)
* [Both feeds combined](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomstuart/hypercritical-feeds/main/hypercritical-with-afterdark.rss)

The latter feed has the After Dark episode timestamps adjusted where necessary
to make them appear in the correct order in podcast clients which sort episodes
chronologically (e.g. Overcast).
